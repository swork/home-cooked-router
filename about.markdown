This is one among several projects I've let get clogged up and that I'm trying to clear quickly. These docs are mostly about me remembering what I did later, but if you find them useful or entertaining, well Good I say, and invite you to [my front page](https//ste.venclare.work/) where more such stuff is linked.

For ease and quickness the docs are rendered in Jekyll.

The theme is their most basic, Minima:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
[jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
