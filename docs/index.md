Already acquired the OrangePi 5 Plus, Huawei's finest attempt to rule the 
world by maybe embedding malicious intent directly in the firmware of the
Rockchip 3588 that I'm entrusting my home network to. Oh well.

Next up, arranging that Ansible modifies their (also dubious) Debian
root image to my purposes, then finally just running off the SD card. I
have an SSD on order, $20 for 256GB, but may not even use it.
